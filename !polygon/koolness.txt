:: system requirements
   .min 486DX (maybe even 386+387), 8 MB RAM, VGA, DOS 3.3+ and of course,
        an ESS AudioDrive/Solo-1 sound card with ESFM (ES1688 or higher)
        obviously, without ESFM-enabled card you can't hear songs :)

        "nointro" may work even on 4 MB, untested. such high memory req's are
        because the musicdisk preloads all songs in RAM to quickly switch
        between them (especially in dos shell mode)
        
   .rec Pentium 90, 16 MB RAM, fast PCI VGA card for 60fps

   for ESS ISA cards, make sure that the BLASTER variable is set correctly!
   Solo-1 is PCI autodetected, but BLASTER settings take precedence.

   works under EMM386/QEMM/Jemm, but if possible, run under HIMEM only

   may work under Win9x (not in the background tho) if VxD drivers are used
   WDM drivers seem to block access to ESFM ports and I have no time to fix.

   if you don't have an ESS card, latest DOSBox-X has recently added ESFM
   emulation - set [sblaster] sbtype=ess688 and oplmode=esfm in dosbox.conf.
   core=dynamic and cycles=100000 are also recommended.
   note that (at the moment of release) ESFM emulation is not very optimized,
   so you may need fast host CPU to run it without glitches.

 :: video settings
   runs in 320x200 8bpp 60hz, supports VGA mode 0x13, Mode-X and VESA modes

   if possible (an if your machine allow), choose 320x200 VESA linear 60fps,
   some videocards (like S3 Trio64) are faster in VESA modes than in VGA.

   keep vsync on, unless the interface is running too choppy (else on fast
   machines, the scroller may run too fast or not work at all)

   ATi users: choose 320x240 VESA (not VGA), vsync on.

 :: command line
   auto    - automatic video mode selection
   potato  - lower graphics quality (may help for a bit)
   nointro - skip intro
   rtc     - use RTC IRQ8 for timing instead of IRQ0
   fast    - remove delays from ESFM register write routine
             (can be used to improve speed, but may introduce sound glitches)

 :: keys
   Up/Down - select song
   Enter   - play selected song
   +/-     - mixer FM volume up/down
   L       - toggle play mode (sequential, loop one song, or shuffle playlist) 
   Esc     - exit

   and a couple of additional keys:
   D       - DOS shell (see below)
   P       - toggle low and normal graphics quality
   B       - show debug statistics
   R       - toggle CPU usage rasterbar
   F       - toggle remove delays from ESFM register write routine
 
 :: dos shell
    yes, you can jam to the ESFM tunes and simultaneously work in DOS!
    note that this is wildly experimental stuff, and i take no responsibility
    for any screw-ups and bugs - use at your own risk :)

    if any DOS application reprograms IRQ0, music tempo will screw up! in 
    this case, run musicdisk with "rtc" switch to use RTC IRQ8 instead of IRQ0

    by default, PMODE/W is configured to take all the extended memory in
    the system, so if you shell out to DOS, EMS/XMS memory is not available.
    
    fortunately, there is a workaround - use external DPMI server such as 
    HDPMI32, which allocates DPMI memory on demand:
     ------- cut -----------
      hdpmi32.exe -r               // make HDPMI32 resident
      koolness.exe rtc             // use RTC IRQ8 to keep music tempo
     ------- cut -----------
    then press 'D' in main menu and you're set!
    another neat feature of HDPMI32 is that it can run multiple DPMI apps
    at once - including DOOM ;)

 :: bugs and issues
    sorry for slow intro - made in a total hurry and totally unoptimized :)
    dos shell is not quite stable for the same reason
